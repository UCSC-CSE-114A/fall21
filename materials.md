## Dev Container

We have created a [VS Code Development Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to
help bootstrap your Haskell development. This is a docker container pre-configured with 
a Haskell environment that you can interact with directly from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

You can download the latest version of the devcontainer [here](https://github.com/UCSC-CSE-114A/cs114a-devcontainer/releases/latest). See the included [README](https://github.com/UCSC-CSE-114A/cs114a-devcontainer) for installation instructions.

## Textbooks
There are no required textbooks for this course, but using one or more of the
following textbooks to expand your understanding of course topics is highly
recommended. In particular, these textbooks are good sources of example
problems to test your understanding of course concepts. When a free online copy
is available (either a preprint or an ebook via the UCSC library), I've noted
it below. More ebooks may become available through the library soon.
