policies:
  - Students are evaluated on the basis of homeworks, labs, a midterm, and a final exam.
  - <b>Regrades must be requested within 2 weeks of receiving graded assignment.</b>
  - A valid regrade request should include a specific reason for the regrade.
  - Remember that we try very hard to assign partial credit fairly and consistently, so unless an actual
    mistake occurred, your regrade request may be declined to ensure fairness to all students.
