  - You have a <b>total of four late days</b> that you can use throughout the quarter as you need them. 
  - A late day means anything between 1 second and 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline. 
  - You should save your late days for when unexpected circumstances arise that prevent you from turning in your homework on time. 
  - <b><em>It is very unlikely that additional extensions beyond these four days will be approved, so use them wisely.</em></b>
